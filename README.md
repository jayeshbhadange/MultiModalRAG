# Multimodal RAG with Gemini 1.5 Flash and Pinecone

A powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines text and visual understanding using Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model and Pinecone vector database. This implementation provides advanced multimodal capabilities for processing and querying documents with both text and images.

## Features

- **Multimodal Processing**: Extract and understand both text and visual content from documents
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Fast semantic search using Pinecone vector database
- **Flexible Querying**: Support for both text-based and visual-based queries
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large document collections
- **Easy Integration**: Simple CLI for processing documents and querying the system

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Gemini API key with access to GPT-4 Vision
- Pinecone API key
- Poppler (for PDF processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multimodal-rag.git
   cd multimodal-rag
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install Poppler (required for PDF processing):
   - On macOS: `brew install poppler`
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`
   - On Windows: Download from [Poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/)

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   ```

## Usage

### Processing Documents

To process a PDF document:
```bash
python main.py process path/to/your/document.pdf
```

### Querying the System

Ask a question about your documents:
```bash
python main.py query "Your question here"
```

To include visual context in the response (for documents with images):
```bash
python main.py query "Your question about images here" --vision
```

### Clearing the Vector Store

To clear all stored vectors:
```bash
python main.py clear
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `config.py`: Configuration settings and environment variables
  - `document_processor.py`: Handles PDF processing and text/image extraction
  - `vector_store.py`: Manages interactions with Pinecone
  - `query_processor.py`: Handles query processing and response generation
- `data/`
  - `documents/`: Store your PDFs here
  - `images/`: Temporary storage for extracted images
- `main.py`: Command-line interface

## Example Workflow

1. Add a PDF document to the `data/documents/` directory
2. Process the document:
   ```bash
   python main.py process data/documents/your_document.pdf
   ```
3. Query the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py query "What are the key points from this document?"
   ```
4. For documents with images, ask about visual content:
   ```bash
   python main.py query "Describe the charts in this document" --vision
   ```

## Customization

You can customize various parameters in `src/config.py`:
- Chunk size and overlap for document processing
- Embedding model configuration
- Directory paths
- API settings

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Poppler**: Ensure Poppler is installed and in your system PATH
- **API Errors**: Verify your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
- **Memory Issues**: For large documents, you may need to adjust chunk sizes
